# MXN600

## Github set up
3 different files for us to work independently.
1 master file where we add final code that works
readme - instructions, notes to self and others, etc.
data files = data files
variable name file to detail the variable names


## Variable Names
bm.test - benchmark testing data
bm.train - benchmark training data
bm.valid - benchmark validation data
ev - extended dataset (for parts 3-5 part of Assignment)


## Example names
bm.train.glm.full - fitting a full glm model to training data


Arnald - look at graphs, how can we change the graph, graphs to include in the SoaP (definitely in the RoC and converge to Gini in the plot)
Ian - function creation, 
Morgan - continue model fit testing



## 11/10/2023
Arnald: task 2, exploratory plots for ev, powerpoint, soap
Morgan: chi sqaure for ian vs my model, fitting extended model
Ian: variable scaling etc., another model test?

# Presentation feedback
Don't use linear regression/correlation plots to explore a binary outcome. Better off putting repay_fail on x-axis and using boxplots are bar charts the way Arnald has for other plots.

Don't justify removing covariates based on level of significance in model summary.

# Going forward:
Arnald to adjust the exploratory plots.
Morgan to streamline and finalise model selection and fit.

Select 2 models - one for the use case of predicting most loan defaults. The other for the use case of the greatest overall accuracy of loan repayment (repay in full or default).

Meet next wednesday to finalise report.
